# Mitron-Bank-Credit-Card-Launch-Strategy

## Company Overview
- Mitron Bank is an imaginary legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad, India.
- It operates in five major Indian cities: Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Delhi NCR, and Hyderabad.
- The bank has a strong presence in traditional banking services and is now seeking to diversify its offerings.
- Goal: Expand its reach in the competitive financial market.
  
## Problem Statement
- Mitron Bank aims to diversify its product portfolio by launching a new line of credit cards. However, it currently lacks deep insights into customer demographics, income levels, and spending behaviorsâ€”limiting its ability to craft a targeted and competitive product strategy.
- A data-driven analysis is essential to guide effective credit card positioning across cities and customer segments.

## Project Objective
- Design a user-friendly dashboard for top-level management and the product strategy team, offering insights into customer demographics, income levels, and spending behavior across key cities.
- Enable stakeholders to identify high-potential customer segments for targeted credit card adoption.
- Provide clarity on spending preferences to inform credit card design and align offerings with customer needs.

## Data Overview
To kickstart the project, Mitron Bank shared a pilot dataset of 4,000 customers from five major cities for preliminary analysis. The objective was to validate the approach before proceeding with a full-scale rollout.  

The dataset consists of two CSV files:

- dim_customer Contains customer demographic details such as:
  - Unique Customer ID
  - Age Group
  - City
  - Occupation
  - Gender
  - Marital Status
  - Average Monthly Income
  
- fact_spent Includes monthly transaction data with:
  - Customer ID
  - Month of Transaction
  - Spending Category
  - Payment Type
  - Amount Spent

The dataset is fully accessible on the Codebasics website and can be viewed via the [link](https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge)
